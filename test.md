As described below, the value \$pbest_{i}\$ represented the previous best vector of the \$i_{{\rm th}}\$ particle, denoted as \$p_{{\rm i}}=(p_{i1}, p_{i2}, \ldots, p_{iD})\$. The gbest was the common objective vector of all individual \$pbest_{i}\$ values, and is denoted as \$g=(g_{1}, g_{2}, \ldots, g_{D})\$. The current vector of the \$i_{{\rm th}}\$ particle is represented as \$x_{i}=(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{iD}) {\rm x}\in(X_{\min}, X_{\max})^{D}\$ in which \$X_{\min}\$ and \$X_{\max}\$ are respectively represented as the minimum and maximum SNP number and the symbol \$D\$ represents the number of \$D\$ dimensions in \$x_{i}\$. In addition, the velocity of the \$i_{{\rm th}}\$ particle is represented as \$v_{i}=(v_{i1}\$, \$v_{i2}, \ldots, v_{i{\rm D}})v\in[V_{\min}, V_{\max}]^{D}\$. The updated equations can be formulated as:$$\eqalignno{&v_{id}^{new}=w\times v_{id}^{old}+c_{1}\times r_{1}\times(pbest_{id}-x_{id}^{old})+c_{2}\times r_{2}\times(gbest_{d}-x_{id}^{old})&{\hbox{ (1)}}\cr &x_{id}^{new}=x_{id}^{old}+v_{id}^{new}&{\hbox{(2)}}}$$
